# McPhysics

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Spinmob/spinmob/Egg/10-dark-theme.png)

This is a library of tools spefically aimed at the McGill undergraduate physics labs, namely PHYS 359/469 at the moment. It can be thought of as an augmentation of the [Spinmob](https://github.com/Spinmob/spinmob/wiki) library, which provides general-purpose, broadly applicable data handling, plotting, fitting, graphical interface, and other analysis tools. 

The installation discussed below automatically installs Spinmob, and you can read the [Spinmob wiki](https://github.com/Spinmob/spinmob/wiki), which provides a lot of information about Python, data handling, automated fitting, and graphical interface building.

## Recommended installation method

Below is the standard installation method that works most reliably. Note many people already have a conda python installation and either do not want to mess with it or cannot make the following installation work due to library conflicts; in these cases, we recommend [creating a new conda environment](https://github.com/Spinmob/mcphysics#creating-and-activating-a-new-environment) as discussed below.

1. Download and install [Miniconda Python 3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or the full bloaty [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/). See additional instructions below for OSX. 

2. From the Anaconda Prompt (or system terminal, depending on your installation options), install the "core" packages:
   ```
   conda install pip spyder pyqtgraph
   ```
   then
   ```
   pip install spinmob mcphysics imageio sounddevice
   ```

3. Open Spyder and start playing. Example script:
   ```
   import mcphysics
   mcphysics.playground.fitting_statistics_demo()
   ```

## OSX Notes
You may need to tell your system where Anaconda's `bin` folder is located manually. A method that worked is to create a text file named `.bash_profile` in your home directory, and add the line `export PATH="/path/to/Anaconda3/bin:$PATH"`, replacing `/path/to/Anaconda3` with the appropriate location of the `bin` folder. Log out and back in, and the terminal should now "know about" `conda` and `pip`.

## Creating and Activating a New Environment

If you wish to create a completely "clean" conda environment, you can do so with the following commands. Once a new environment is activated, you can then install packages as discussed above.

1. To create a clean environment named `pants`, use the command below (following the resulting instructions):
   ```
   conda create --name pants
   ```
   
2. To activate the environment:
   ```
   conda activate pants
   ```

3. To see which environments exist and which is activated (has a `*` next to it):
   ```
   conda env list
   ```
   
## Upgrading
To upgrade to the latest stable versions,
   ```
   pip install mcphysics spinmob --upgrade --no-cache-dir
   ```

## Optional instrument drivers

If you need to talk to the supported equipment, you may also need to install some drivers.

### VISA and serial instruments
To access VISA-based instruments (see below) you will also need a "standard" VISA driver, such as Rhode & Schwartz VISA or National Instruments VISA. I recommend [Rhode & Schwarz](https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/ca/driver-pages/remote-control/3-visa-and-tools_231388.html) because it's lightweight and works with everything we've tested. You will then need to run `pip install pyvisa pyserial` to get python access.

### ADALM2000
To access an ADALM2000, you will need to install [libiio](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio) and [libm2k (with python bindings!)](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libm2k). On Windows, you will also need the [m2k driver](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/plutosdr-m2k-drivers-win/releases), and you may have to download the appropriate `*.whl` file for your system, then manually run a `pip install [filename].whl` from the anaconda prompt to get it into python. On Linux (and probably osx), we are required to manually compile the libm2k library, so McPhysics may require a specific version to be installed. If this is the case, `import mcphysics` should complain and tell you which version is required when you try to access the device.

### Fancy sound cards
Fancy sound cards may require their own drivers to be installed, but do not need anything more than the `sounddevice` library, which is installed by default above.

## Organization
The McPhysics library is organized heirarchically, and you should use Spyder's code completion suggestions to navigate it. You can also type `<ctrl>-i` while your cursor is beside an object to access its documentation. Below is a list of the existing functionality. All of these objects are documented within the code itself, and detailed help is available via python's `help()` command or your favorite IDE's or ipython's built in help / autocomplete functionality. An introduction to some of the complex items is available on our (growing) [wiki](https://github.com/Spinmob/mcphysics/wiki).
