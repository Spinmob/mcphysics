# Windows:
#  Install Rhode & Schwarz VISA or NI-VISA
#  pip install pyvisa
#  Name the scope something reasonable in OpenChoice Instrument Manager
#
# Linux
#  pip install pyvisa pyvisa-py
#  Let me know if you find out how to name the scope.

# Feature to implement
#  * Sillyscope: Find trigger time and define this to be zero.
#  * Sillyscope: Option to query full data set

# ISSUES:
# * Rigol B: switching from peak detect to normal in between runs causes acquire button to fail once.
# * ADALM2000 Enabling channels doesn't seem to change the incoming data. Currently it just ignores the disabled ones.
